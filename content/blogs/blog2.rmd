# Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing
The goal is to analyze how TfL bike sharing rentals change by time.

## Step1: Load data from Internet
```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```
## Step2: drawing plot
plot1: use facet_grid() function
```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
bike%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=bikes_hired))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_grid(rows=vars(year),
             cols = vars(month),
             scales="free")+
               theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
                     axis.text = element_text(size = 5),
                     axis.title = element_blank(),
                     axis.text.y = element_blank())+
               labs(title = "Distribution of bikes hired by month and year",
                    caption = "1",
                    x="Bike Rentals")

```



plot2 and 3: use geom_ribbon() function to draw shadow between line
```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}

# tables
table_1 <- bike %>%
  filter(year>=2016 & year <=2019)%>%
group_by(year,month) %>%
summarise(monthly_bike=mean(bikes_hired))

table_2 <- table_1 %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(monthly_average = mean(monthly_bike))

table_3 <- bike %>%
  filter(year>=2016)%>%
group_by(year,month) %>%
summarise(monthly_bike2=mean(bikes_hired))

merge_table <- left_join(table_3,table_2,by = "month")

```


```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change2, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
merge_table %>% ggplot(aes(x = month, group =1))+
  geom_line(aes(x = month, y = monthly_bike2), color = "black") +
  geom_line(aes(x = month, y=monthly_average), color = "blue", size = 2)+
  geom_ribbon(
             aes(ymin=monthly_average,ymax=pmin(monthly_bike2, monthly_average)),
             fill="red", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_ribbon(
             aes(ymin= monthly_bike2, ymax = pmin(monthly_bike2, monthly_average)),
             fill="green", alpha = 0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~ year)+
  labs(title = "Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals", subtitle = "Change from monthly average shown in blue and calculated between 2016-2019", y="Bike rentals", x="Month")
  

```

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
#knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
# tables

table_1 <- bike%>%
  filter(year >= 2016 & year <= 2019)%>%
  group_by(year,week) %>%
  summarise(mean=mean(bikes_hired))

table_2 <- table_1 %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarise(mean2=mean(mean))

table_3 <-bike%>%
   filter(year >= 2016)%>%
   group_by(year,week) %>%
   summarise(mean3=mean(bikes_hired))

table_4 = table_3[-c(293),]
  
merge_table <- left_join(table_4, table_2, by="week")%>%
   mutate(percentage_change = (mean3/mean2-1)*100,
          color_id=if_else(as.numeric(percentage_change)>0,
                            "green",
                            "red"))

m <- 0
 merge_table %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x=week,y=percentage_change,group=1))+
   geom_line(aes(y=percentage_change))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = m) +
   geom_ribbon(
             aes(ymin=m,ymax=pmin(m, percentage_change)),
             fill="red", alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_ribbon(
             aes(ymin= percentage_change, ymax = pmin(m, percentage_change)),
             fill="green", alpha = 0.2) +
   facet_wrap(~ year)+
   labs(title = "Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals", subtitle = "% Change from weekly averages calculated between 2016-2019",y="%", x="Week")+

```
> We used the mean to calculate our expected rentals as when we tested using the median it was quite different from the actual numbers. 

> The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

> It's interesting to note that during the 2020 lockdown, rentals decreased by half in comparison to other years.
