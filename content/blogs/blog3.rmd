# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors
Here we will explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. 

## Step1: load the data and examine its structure
```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv("D:/Haxino/Documents/LBS/2021Fall/Applied_Stats/am01/data/movies.csv")
glimpse(movies)
```
## Step2: calculate the confidence interval and produce plot
We calculate and produce the graph shows the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors. 
```{r}
grouped_table <- movies %>% filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>% group_by(director)
clean_table <- grouped_table  %>% summarise(mean = mean(rating), sd = sd(rating), sample_size = n(), se = sd/sqrt(sample_size), t_critical = qt(0.975, sample_size -1), lower = mean - t_critical * se, upper = mean + t_critical * se)

clean_table %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_errorbarh(aes(y = director, xmax = upper, xmin = lower, colour = director), width = 0.1, size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mean, y = director, colour = director), size = 5) + 
  geom_text(x = clean_table$upper, y = clean_table$director, label = round(clean_table$upper,2), vjust = -2, size = 4) +
  geom_text(x = clean_table$lower, y = clean_table$director, label = round(clean_table$lower,2), vjust = -2, size = 4) +
  geom_text(x = clean_table$mean, y = clean_table$director, label = round(clean_table$mean,2), vjust = -2, size = 5) +
  geom_rect(xmin = 7.27, xmax = 7.33, ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf, alpha = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Do Speilberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings",
    subtitle = "95% percent confidence interval overlap",
    x = "mean IMDB ratings"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```

> The sample mean of Spielberg's mean IMDB ratings is 7.57 and the confidence interval range from 7.27 to 7.87. The sample mean of Burton's mean IMDB ratings is 6.93 and the confidence interval from 6.53 to 7.33. 


## Step3: Hypothesis Test and t-statistics
We run a hypothesis test, using both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where we assume zero difference between the two.

Null hypothesis is that Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings. The Alternative Hypothesis is that Speilberg and Burton doesn't have the same mean IMDB ratings. 

```{r}
# t.test()
t.test(rating ~ director ,data = grouped_table)

# infer 
set.seed(1234)
infer_table <- grouped_table %>% specify(rating ~ director) %>% hypothesise(null = "independence") %>% generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% calculate(stat = "diff in means") 

observed_stat <- grouped_table %>% specify(rating ~ director) %>% calculate(stat = "diff in means")

infer_table %>% get_pvalue(obs_stat = observed_stat, direction = "both")

```
>The t-stat for the hypothesis test is 0.01, which is smaller than 95% confidence interval p-value. The 95% confidence interval range is from 0.16 to 1.13, so 0 is out of the confidence interval. Therefore, there's enough evidence for us to conclude that we can do that Speilberg and Burton doesn't have the same population mean IMDB ratings.
