<h1>Challenge 1: Replicating a chart</h1>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your <code>dplyr</code> and <code>ggplot2</code> skills. Read the article <a href="https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have">The Racial Factor: There’s 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?</a> and have a look at the attached figure.</p>
<p><img src="D:/Haxino/Documents/my_website/my_website/images/vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpeg" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>You don’t have to worry about the blue-red backgrouns and don’t worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You’re encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out– and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.</p>
<p>Some hints to get you started:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To get vaccination by county, we will use <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh">data from the CDC</a></li>
<li>You need to get <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ">County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020</a></li>
<li>Finally, you also need an estimate of the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232">population of each county</a></li>
</ol>
