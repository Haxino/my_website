# Challenge 1: Vaccination Rate vs. Trump Vote Rate

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.


```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpeg"), error = FALSE)
```

You don't have to worry about the blue-red backgrouns and don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out-- and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.

Some hints to get you started:

1.  To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh)
2.  You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
3.  Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)

# Challange 2: Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as charactersa
clean_approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% mutate(
  startdate = mdy(approval_polllist$startdate),
  enddate = mdy(approval_polllist$enddate)  
)

```

## Create a plot

We calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. We plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. 

The plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)

# clean table
clean_data <- clean_approval_polllist %>% filter(subgroup == "All polls") %>%
  select(enddate, approve, disapprove) %>%
  mutate(week = week(enddate),
         net_approval_rate = approve - disapprove)
```


```{r trump2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
# calculate sample mean and CIs
CI_table <- clean_data %>% group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(net_approval_rate), 
            lower = mean - qt(0.975, n()-1) * (sd(net_approval_rate)/sqrt(n())),
            upper = mean + qt(0.975, n()-1) * (sd(net_approval_rate)/sqrt(n()))
  )

# # merge sample mean with clean table
# merge_table <- CI_table %>% pivot_longer(cols = 2:4, 
#                             names_to = "indicator",
#                             values_to = "value")


# plot
CI_table %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = mean), colour = "Red", size = 0.2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = lower), colour = "Red", size = 0.2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = upper), colour = "Red", size = 0.2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = week, y = mean), colour = "Red", size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = week, y = mean), colour = "Blue", size = 1, se = FALSE) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = week, ymin = lower, ymax = upper), fill = "grey70", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), colour = "Orange", size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Estimating Approval Margin (approve-disapprove) for Joe Biden",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "Week of the year",
    y = "Average Approval Margin(Approve - Disapprove)"
  )

```
`

## Compare Confidence Intervals

The confidence interval for week 4 is [5.28-23.60] in comparison to the confidence interval for week 25 which is [9.79-13.47]. The widths of these two confidence intervals are different, 18.32 for week 4 and 3.68 for week 25. This is due to the difference in sample size, as there were 8 polls in week 4 but 28 polls in week 25.
