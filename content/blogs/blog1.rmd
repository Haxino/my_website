# I. Vaccination Rate vs. Trump Vote Rate
The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills.

## Step1: loading dataset from Internet
1.  Get vaccination by county, use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh)
2.  Get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
3.  Get population from [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Download CDC vaccination by county
cdc_url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
vaccinations <- vroom(cdc_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(fips != "UNK") # remove counties that have an unknown (UNK) FIPS code

# Download County Presidential Election Returns
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ
election2020_results <- vroom("D:/Haxino/Documents/LBS/2021Fall/Applied_Stats/am01/data/countypres_2000-2020.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%

  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>%

  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data
population_url <- "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232"
population <- vroom(population_url) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%

  # select the latest data, namely 2019
  select(fips = fip_stxt, pop_estimate_2019) %>%

  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))
```

## Step2: Merge tables and calculate rate
```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#create trump table
trump_vote <- election2020_results %>% group_by(fips) %>% filter(candidate == "DONALD J TRUMP") %>% summarise(votes = sum(candidatevotes)*100)

# create vaccination table
vaccination_number <- vaccinations %>% filter(date == '09/02/2021') %>% group_by(fips) %>%  select(fips, series_complete_yes) %>% summarise(series_complete_yes = sum(series_complete_yes)*100)

# create full table
full_table <- left_join(vaccination_number, trump_vote, by = 'fips') %>% left_join(population, by = 'fips') %>% mutate(vaccination_rate = series_complete_yes/pop_estimate_2019, trump_vote_rate = votes/pop_estimate_2019) %>% filter(vaccination_rate <= 100, trump_vote_rate<= 100)
```

## Step3: Draw scatter plot
```{r, out.width=50%}
# reproduce graph
full_table %>% ggplot(aes(x = trump_vote_rate, y = vaccination_rate, size = pop_estimate_2019)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  theme_bw() +
    labs(
     title = "COVID-19 VACCINATION LEVELS OUT OF TOTAL POPULATION BY COUNTY",
     x = "2020 Trump Vote %",
     y = "% of Total Population Vaccination"
    )+
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))
```

# II. Biden's Approval Margins

The goal is to show how Biden's vote rate change as time pass since he got into office.

## Step1: Download data from Internet
```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 
glimpse(approval_polllist)
```

## Step2: Cleaning data
Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters. Then calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) and the confidence interval for each week since he got into office

```{r, cache=TRUE}
clean_approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% mutate(
  startdate = mdy(approval_polllist$startdate),
  enddate = mdy(approval_polllist$enddate)  
)

clean_data <- clean_approval_polllist %>% filter(subgroup == "All polls") %>%
  select(enddate, approve, disapprove) %>%
  mutate(week = week(enddate),
         net_approval_rate = approve - disapprove)

# calculate sample mean and CIs
CI_table <- clean_data %>% group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(net_approval_rate), 
            lower = mean - qt(0.975, n()-1) * (sd(net_approval_rate)/sqrt(n())),
            upper = mean + qt(0.975, n()-1) * (sd(net_approval_rate)/sqrt(n()))
  )

```

## Step3: Produce plot and confidence interval
Plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. 

```{r trump2, out.width="50%"}
CI_table %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = mean), colour = "Red", size = 0.2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = lower), colour = "Red", size = 0.2) +
  geom_line(aes(x = week, y = upper), colour = "Red", size = 0.2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = week, y = mean), colour = "Red", size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = week, y = mean), colour = "Blue", size = 1, se = FALSE) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = week, ymin = lower, ymax = upper), fill = "grey70", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), colour = "Orange", size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Estimating Approval Margin (approve-disapprove) for Joe Biden",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls",
    x = "Week of the year",
    y = "Average Approval Margin(Approve - Disapprove)"
  )

```

In general, Biden's average approval margin decreased in increarsing speed after he got into the office. People who used to support him trun into the opposite side. 

The confidence interval for week 4 is [5.28-23.60] in comparison to the confidence interval for week 25 which is [9.79-13.47]. The widths of these two confidence intervals are different, 18.32 for week 4 and 3.68 for week 25. This is due to the difference in sample size, as there were 8 polls in week 4 but 28 polls in week 25. As the sample size increase, the estimation become more accurate so the confidence interval narrow down.
